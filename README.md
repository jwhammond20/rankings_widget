# rankings_widget

The `rankings_widget` is a custom widget developed for the Dynastynerds.com website. The widget was designed to be forward-facing, providing users with easy access to up-to-date rankings information. 

To create the widget, I utilized an API pulled from our public-facing JSON file and integrated the custom code into Elementor via the HTML widget. This allowed for seamless integration with the website's existing design and functionality.

The `rankings_widget` has been well-received by our users and has contributed to an increase in engagement on the website. Its development has been a successful collaboration between the design and development teams, and I am proud to have played a key role in its creation.
